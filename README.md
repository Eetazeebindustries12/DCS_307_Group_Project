# Misinformation-Spread-Simulation

The simulation has 4 core data_types:
edit: scrapped location

simulation: class that contains and updates setting and implements main simulation randomness
user: agents within the simulation, must occupy a certain location within the setting, two main boolean attributes: infected and susceptible
  users have unique interaction types with different other users.
  

work left to do: specifically with user interactions, need to identify random number distributions we want to utilize and also solidify the interaction logic
