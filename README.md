# DCS_307_Group_Project

The simulation has 4 core data_types:
setting: the setting of the simlation
location: cells within the setting
simulation: class that contains and updates setting and implements main simulation randomness
user: agents within the simulation, must occupy a certain location within the setting, two main boolean attributes: infected and susceptible
  users have unique interaction types with different other users.
  

work left to do: specifically with user interactions, need to identify random number distributions we want to utilize and also solidify the interaction logic
